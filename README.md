# Multimodal Deep Learning Approach for Cyclic Peptide-Based Antibiotic Detection

Antibiotic resistance is a growing global concern, making it essential to develop fast and effective ways to detect antibiotics. Cyclic peptides (CPs) are promising candidates for biosensing due to their stability, specificity and ability to form complex structures. This project focuses on using deep learning to design CPs for antibiotic detection, combining multiple data sources to create a powerful AI-driven model. A key component of our approach involves using Molecular Dynamics simulations to generate interaction data between CPs and antibiotics, capturing their behavior under different conditions.
